# Project Description
This project aims to use random prediction to forecast the changes in stock prices. Random forest is a machine learning ensemble method that is widely used. It is an improvement based on decision trees, where decision trees use a tree-like model to represent decisions and their possible outcomes for prediction. Although decision trees are a good starting point, they are very sensitive to changes in input. Random forest, by combining multiple decision trees, reduces overfitting and variance problems, thus making the results more reliable.

# Stakeholder Persona
The main users will be individual and institutional investors who wish to adopt quantitative investment methods. Investors can utilize this project to enhance the accuracy of predictions and strengthen their trading strategies and risk management.
