## 4) Interpretation (write your conclusions below)

- **Linearity:** The residuals scatter randomly around 0, which means a linear model is appropriate.  
- **Homoscedasticity:** The spread of residuals appears random with no clear pattern.  
- **Normality:** The error distribution is approximately normal. Most points lie close to the straight line in the QQ plot.  
- **Independence:** The Durbinâ€“Watson test value is 1.29, which suggests slight positive autocorrelation.  
- **Which model do you trust and why?:** I trust the original model. The alternative model with the squared momentum factor increases positive autocorrelation, making it less reliable.  
- **Next step to try:** Add interaction terms to capture potential nonlinear relationships between predictors.
