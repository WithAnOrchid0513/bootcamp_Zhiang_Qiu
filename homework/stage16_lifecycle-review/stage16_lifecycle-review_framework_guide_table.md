# Applied Financial Engineering — Framework Guide Template

This Framework Guide is a structured reflection tool.  
Fill it in as you progress through the course or at the end of your project.  
It will help you connect each stage of the **Applied Financial Engineering Lifecycle** to your own project, and create a portfolio-ready artifact.

---

## How to Use
- Each row corresponds to one stage in the lifecycle.  
- Use the prompts to guide your answers.  
- Be concise but specific — 2–4 sentences per cell is often enough.  
- This is **not a test prep sheet**. It’s a way to *document, reflect, and demonstrate* your process.

I should also run sensitivity analysis to select the best.*                    |
| **2. Tooling Setup** | *I learned to set up reproducible Python project scaffold. It involves creating an environment for using API, and keeping the API key secret. It also requires showing the requirement so that the code can be easily reproduced in the future.* | *It was initially difficult to set up the API. *                                                                                                                                    | *It was resolved by creating a .env file and putting it in a correct place.*                                                                                                                                        | *The API allows me to automate the data gathering process.*                                                            |

| **6. Data Preprocessing** | *Fill the missing data with median, drop the missing data or normalize the data. *                                                                                                                                                               | *There are many Na values, which makes it difficult since the original data is already small. *                                                                                     | *Since I do not want to further decrease the size of the data, imputation is used. *                                                                                                                                | *By paying attention to data quality and selecting the most appropriate cleaning method. *                             |
| **7. Outlier Analysis** | *I detect outlier using the IQR method, Z score method and the winsorization method. *                                                                                                                                                           | *It is difficult to determine whether an outlier should be kept.*                                                                                                                   | *It has to depend on the data and the scope of the project to determine whether to drop those outliers. While outliers distort the data, they may also be valuable indicators of turning points or regime shifts. * | *I will add a combination of methods and test their combined effect. *                                                 |
| **8. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** | *I used the describe and isna function to get a general picture of the data. Then, I made histogram, scatterplot, heatmap and boxplot to visualize the data. *                                                                                   | *It is difficult to interpret correlation when the data is generated, as there is no benchmark for whether it is high/low and significant or not. *                                 | *I discovered patterns through a combined effort of multiple charts and functions. *                                                                                                                                | *I should also check for stationary.*                                                                                  |
| **9. Feature Engineering** | *I constructed the income_times_credit_ratio and saving feature. *                                                                                                                                                                               | *It is difficult to create additional features given the existing features like credit score and monthly income/spend already represent a significant part of credit worthiness.  * | *I can test the feature's performance by running a confusion matrix and see the accuracy score. *                                                                                                                   | *I can add the length of the credit history.*                                                                          |
| **10.

To fix heteroscedasticity, I can transform the dependent variable. *                                                                                           | *(What alternative models would you try in future?)*                                                                   |
| **11. Evaluation & Risk Communication** | *I evaluated my model using MAE. *                                                                                                                                                                                                               | *The model's performance is dependent on the way outliers are treated, either by dropping or imputation. *                                                                          | *Error are measured in terms of MAE.

## Reflection Prompts

- Which stage was the most **difficult** for you, and why?  The most challenging phase is the tool setup stage, especially when it comes to configuring the API and the environment.
- Which stage was the most **rewarding**?  I enjoyed the feature engineering stage, which is rewarding because finding useful features improve the forecasting accuracy. 
- How do the stages **connect** — where did one stage’s decisions constrain or enable later stages? The decisions made during the data preprocessing and outlier analysis stages directly determine the performance of the model in the modeling and evaluation process.
- If you repeated this project, what would you **do differently across the lifecycle**?  I will incorporate some factors based on specific domains in the feature engineering process, such as volatility clustering phenomena or credit record length, and do more systematic sensitivity tests during the evaluation stage.
- Which skills do you most want to **strengthen** before your next financial engineering project?  I will work on my Pipeline automation skills before the next project.
